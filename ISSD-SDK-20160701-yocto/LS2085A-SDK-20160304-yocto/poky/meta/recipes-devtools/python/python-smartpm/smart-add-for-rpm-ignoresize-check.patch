python-smartpm: Add checking for "rpm-ignoresize" option

The do_rootfs takes a very long time when build host has mounted many NFS
devices. syscall lstat() was being called on every filesystem mounted on the
build host during building.
The reason for the lstat() is that rpm is verifying that enough free disk space
is available to do the install. However, since the install is into the target
rootfs it should not matter how much free space there is in the host mounts.
Add checking for "rpm-ignoresize", by it, smart can make whether RPM skip
checking for diskspace when install a rpm package.
