They managed to 'break' tar. Again. Sorry, they fixed a regression
which broke dpkg-deb.

The addition of:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=163e96a0e619a900eab6de827c7c5749ecc9d3f2
("Bugfix: entries read from the -T file did not get proper matching_flag.")
means that the no-recursion option gets lost. This leads to many files getting included
multiple times, along with files which shouldn't be there.

The commit message is horrendous. The patch actually makes the option positional 
(as documnted since 2003) and therefore doesn't affect the input from the -T option.

Moving the --no-reursion option to earlier in the command avoids the bug.

The bug was not present in tar 1.28 however it has been backported in at least 
Fedora 22 and heading into Fedora 21.
