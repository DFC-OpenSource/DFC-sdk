	        * Makefile (install-headers): Preserve old behavior: depend on
	        $(inst_includedir)/gnu/stubs.h only if install-bootstrap-headers
	        is set; otherwise, place gnu/stubs.h on the 'install-others' list.

	        * Makefile: Amend make install-headers to install everything
	        necessary for building a cross-compiler.  Install gnu/stubs.h as
	        part of 'install-headers', not 'install-others'.
	        If install-bootstrap-headers is 'yes', install a dummy copy of
	        gnu/stubs.h, instead of computing the real thing.
	        * include/stubs-bootstrap.h: New file.

+/* Placeholder stubs.h file for bootstrapping.
+
+   When bootstrapping a GCC/EGLIBC pair, GCC requires that the EGLIBC
+   headers be installed, but we can't fully build EGLIBC without that
+   GCC.  So we run the command:
+
+      make install-headers install-bootstrap-headers=yes
+
+   to install the headers GCC needs, but avoid building certain
+   difficult headers.  The <gnu/stubs.h> header depends, via the
+   EGLIBC subdir 'stubs' make targets, on every .o file in EGLIBC, but
+   an empty stubs.h like this will do fine for GCC.  */
