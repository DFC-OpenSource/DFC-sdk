Sadly cmake is broken. If it sees this reference and ansidecl is present, it will add a 
dependency upon it, even if HAVE_ANSIDEC_H is never set.

The easiest solution is to remove these lines, otherwise recipes like libzypp can have a 
dependency on the ansidecl.h header via cmake. This can lead to odd results if the 
header is removed (clean binutils) and then the code is recompiled.
