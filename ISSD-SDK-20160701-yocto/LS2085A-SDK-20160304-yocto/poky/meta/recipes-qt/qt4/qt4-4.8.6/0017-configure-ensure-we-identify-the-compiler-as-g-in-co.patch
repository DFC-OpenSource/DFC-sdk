Subject: [PATCH 17/21] configure: ensure we identify the compiler as g++ in
 configure

Our PLATFORM in OE is ${TARGET_OS}-oe-g++, and previously the configure
script was interpreting from this that the compiler was "oe-g++" and
thus
g++ specific checks were not being run since this string did not match;
among other things this resulted in a compiler version check in the
QtWebKit build code not working, and hence the following error at build
time:

./wtf/NullPtr.h:48:1: error: identifier 'nullptr' will become a keyword
in C++0x [-Werror=c++0x-compat]

The easiest thing since our PLATFORM is entirely artificial is to just
force COMPILER to "g++" in the configure script if it is detected as
"oe-g++".
