Subject: [libhugetlbfs][PATCH] Extend arm32 support to include BE variants
    
This patch applies the same technique used by Koen Kool in the following patch
which was accepted by the libhugetlbfs project:
    
[0a4f6] Add aarch64_be_support 2014-03-31 10:52:37
    
It modifies the libhugetlbfs Makefile to mark all 32-bit arm architectures
as supported by the libhugetlbfs build.  Builds and successful functional
tests have been performed for armv7a LE and BE runtime platforms.
    
This patch replaces and renders obsolete the following patch:
arm32-support.patch submitted by: Chunrong Guo <B40290@freescale.com>
