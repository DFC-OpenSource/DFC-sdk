This layer depends on:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/oe-core.git
branch: fido
revision: HEAD

And we're working to break the dependency on this one:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe.git
branch: fido
revision: HEAD

To make BBMASK'ing per layer possible the following directory structure is
used:

$[LAYERDIR}/<layer name>/recipes-<group-name>/<recipe-name>/<recipe-name>.bbappend

Send pull requests to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org with '[meta-oe][meta-systemd][fido]' in the subject'

When sending single patches, please use something like:
'git send-email -M -1 --to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org --subject-prefix=meta-oe][meta-systemd][fido][PATCH'

You are encouraged to fork the mirror on github https://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe/ to share your patches, this is preferred for patch sets consisting of more than one patch. Other services like gitorious, repo.or.cz or self hosted setups are of course accepted as well, 'git fetch <remote>' works the same on all of them. We recommend github because it is free, easy to use, has been proven to be reliable and has a really good web GUI.
