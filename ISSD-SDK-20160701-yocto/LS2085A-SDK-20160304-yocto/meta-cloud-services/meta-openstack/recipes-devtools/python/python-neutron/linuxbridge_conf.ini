[VLANS]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST change this to
# 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below in order for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to
# disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.
#
# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/neutron_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main neutron server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)
sql_connection = postgresql://%DB_USER%:%DB_PASSWORD%@localhost/neutron
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - if the initial connection to the
# database fails
reconnect_interval = 2
# Enable the use of eventlet's db_pool for MySQL. The flags sql_min_pool_size,
# sql_max_pool_size and sql_idle_timeout are relevant only if this is enabled.
# sql_dbpool_enable = False
# Minimum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# sql_min_pool_size = 1
# Maximum number of SQL connections to keep open in a pool
# sql_max_pool_size = 5
# Timeout in seconds before idle sql connections are reaped
# sql_idle_timeout = 3600

[LINUX_BRIDGE]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
#
# Default: physical_interface_mappings =
# Example: physical_interface_mappings = physnet1:eth1

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
polling_interval = 2

[SECURITYGROUP]
# Firewall driver for realizing neutron security group function
firewall_driver = neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver
