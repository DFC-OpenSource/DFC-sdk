Subject: [PATCH] rdoc: fixup opt.banner heredoc

rdoc has some quirks with heredoc which in this case would
manifest in to a parse error.

| RDoc::Parser::Ruby failure around line 25 of
| lib/pry/commands/ls.rb

Fixup the heredoc to use a more standard format which is known
not to mess up rdoc processing.
