===================

This layer provides support for building the packages required to support cloud

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/oe-core.git
branch: master
revision: HEAD
prio: default

There are six openstack layers that are used to build a controller/compute
node image pair. The dependencies of these layers are also required for a
build, and are listed in the layers themselves.

   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack
   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack-compute-deploy
   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack-controller-deploy
   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack-qemu
   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack-compute-test-config
   - meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack-controller-test-config
