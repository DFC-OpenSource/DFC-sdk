Overview

DESCRIPTION

    T1040 integrates a Gigabit Ethernet switch core with eight 10/100/1000 Mbps
    Ethernet ports and two 10/100/1000/2500 Mbps ports.

=====================================================================
L2switch Node

Description

    This node specifies the address range of l2switch configuration registers
    and interrupts.  It also contains a set of child nodes defining the
    Ethernet ports.

PROPERTIES

   - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Must include "vitesse-9953"

   - reg
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Standard property which specifies the physical address and
      length of the l2switch configuration registers.

   - interrupts
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
      Definition:  Standard property, specifies the interrupts generated by
           this device.
           The value of the interrupts property consists of one interrupt
           specifier.  The format of the specifier is defined by the binding
           document describing the node's interrupt parent.

=====================================================================
Port Node

Description

    This node specifies the status and connection type of each of the Ethernet
    ports.

PROPERTIES

   - compatible
     Usage: required
     Value type: <string>
     Definition: Must include "vitesse-9953-port"

   - port-index
     Usage: required
     Value type: <u32>
     Definition: Specifies the port index.  Values 0, 1 are used by the two
             internal 10/100/1000/2500 Mbps ports, values 2-9 are used by the
             eight external 10/100/1000 Mbps ports.

   - phy-connection-type
     Usage: required
     Value type: <string>
     Definition: Specifies the controller/PHY interface type.

   - status
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <string>
     Definition: Standard property.
             Indicates the operational status of the port.  "disabled" is used
             to indicate that the port is not usable (for example because the
             QSGMII link to the PHYs is not available with current RCW).

   - fixed-link
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
     Definition: Specifies link parameters in the absence of a PHY.
             <a b c d e> where a is emulated phy id - must be unique to among
             all specified fixed-links, b is duplex - 0 half, 1 full, c is
             link speed - 10/100/1000/2500, d is pause - 0 no pause, 1 pause,
             e is asym_pause - 0 no asym_pause, 1 asym_pause.

  - phy-handle
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <phandle>
     Definition: The phandle for the PHY connected to this l2switch port.


    Note: All other standard properties (see the ePAPR) are allowed but are
    optional.
