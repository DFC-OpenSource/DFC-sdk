 * A stateful Flow is a series of non-interleaved (i.e. Frames from different
 * Streams do not interleave within a Flow) Streams to be processed, where a
 * Stream consists of a series of Frames from the same Flow that together
 * comprise a complete entity to be compressed/decompressed (e.g. GZIP member,
 * ZLIB stream, or DEFLATE block). DCE maintains a set of Stream Context values,
 * or state, for each Stream across the individual Frames that comprise it.
 * Thus, an in-order series, or Stream, of Frames, making up a complete entity
 * can be processed over time by DCE without having to be reassembled first.
 * Further, if processing of an individual Frame within the Stream is
 * interrupted due to insufficient output buffer space, DCE provides a
 * mechanism to resume processing of the Stream at a later time with additional
 * output buffer supplied.
 *
 * A stateless Flow is a series of single Frame Streams that are to be
 * processed, but DCE does not maintain any Stream Context between individual
 * Frames. From DCEâ€™s point of view, each dequeued Frame on a stateless
 * Flow is an atomic work unit. If processing of a Frame is interrupted for any
 * reason, DCE returns it with an exception code but does not maintain or update
 * any Stream Context that would allow resumption of processing.

 * the interrupted Frame, and all subsequently drained Frames, to DCE with an

/**

 *
 * @flow:an initialized dce flow object
 * @flags:
 * @fd: dpaa frame descriptor to enqueue
 * @callback_tag: optional, returned to the user in associated callback function
 *
 * The PROCESS Command invokes DCEâ€™s mission mode operation. It indicates to
 * DCE that the provided Frame structure (simple or compound) is to be
 * processed according to the mode of its Frame Queue channel and the Frameâ€™s
 * associated Stream Context Record, and/or a Stream Configuration Frame. The
 * PROCESS Command is analogous to an invocation of the zlib inflate() or
 * deflate() function call.
 *
 * On a stateful Flow, the DCE will process the provided input Frame,
 * potentially write some produced output data into the output Frame (less any
 * residue data held back), and update the Stream Context Record in
 * anticipation of processing a subsequent PROCESS command on the same Stream.
 *
 * On a stateless Flow, the DCE will attempt to fully process the input Frame
 * and write all produced output data into the output Frame. If the DCE cannot
 * complete processing of the input Frame it is simply returned with an error
 * indication code. No continuation of processing, as is done in a typical zlib
 * function call, is possible using DCE-maintained context.
 *
 * Simple Frames may optionally have their component buffers released to BMan
 * as the Frame is processed.  The simple output Frame that is returned to
 * Software is constructed of buffers that are acquired from BMan.
 *
 * Compound Frames also may optionally have their component buffers released to
 * BMan. Compound output Frames may be pre-built or constructed of buffers that
 * are acquired from BMan.
 *
 * It is valid for DCE to receive a PROCESS Command Frame that has a null or
 * zero-length input buffer or zero-length output buffer. DCE will attempt to
 * process the Frame and update Stream Context Record if necessary.
 *
 * For creating GZIP or ZLIB compressed members, the PROCESS Command relies on
 * the following values in the Stream Configuration Frame, or the Stream Context
 * Record, fields being valid when the initial Frame of a series (i.e. a Stream)
 * of Frames is dequeued from QMan:
 *	- ID1, ID2: Required for compression of GZIP members. Values will be
 *		placed into the created header.
 *	- CM: Required for compression of GZIP or ZLIB members. Value will be
 *		places into the created header. This 8-bit field contains the
 *		8-bit CM field for GZIP compression and the 8-bit CMF field for
 *		ZLIB compression.
 *	- FLG: Required for compression of GZIP or ZLIB members. Value will be
 *		placed into the created header, with unsupported options
 *		overridden to 0 (i.e. FDICT) and computed values overridden by
 *		DCE (i.e. FCHECK).
 *	- MTIME: Only required for creation of GZIP members. Value will be
 *		placed into the created GZIP header.
 *	- XFL: Only required for creation of GZIP members. Value will be placed
 *		into the created GZIP header.
 *	- OS: Only required for creation of GZIP members. Value will be placed
 *		into the created GZIP header.
 *	- XLEN: Only required for creation of GZIP members. If FLG.FEXTRA is set
 *		XLEN bytes of data will be read from EXTRA_PTR and inserted into
 *		the GZIP header.
 *	- NLEN: Only required for creation of GZIP members. If FLG.FNAME is set,
 *		NLEN bytes of data will be read from (EXTRA_PTR + XLEN) and
 *		inserted into the GZIP header. Note that it does not matter
 *		whether or not FLG.FEXTRA is set.
 *	- CLEN: Only required for creation of GZIP members. If FLG.FCOMMENT is
 *		set, CLEN bytes of data will be read from (EXTRA_PTR + XLEN +
 *		NLEN) and inserted into the GZIP header. Note that it does not
 *		matter whether or not FLG.FEXTRA or FLG.FNAME is set.
 *	- EXTRA_PTR: Only required for creation of GZIP members. Only required
 *		if one or more of XLEN, NLEN, or CLEN is non-zero.
 *
 * All other Stream Context Record fields will be initialized by DCE prior to
 * processing the first input Frame (denoted by a set I bit). Any stale values
 * present are ignored and updated afterwards. Note that in order for the
 * created compressed stream to be RFC compliant, care must be taken to ensure
 * that the provisioned header values are consistent with DCEâ€™s output. For
 * example, DCE is only capable of producing GZIP streams with CM=8 and CINFO=4,
 * so these values must be provisioned in order to create properly formed GZIP
 * members.
 *
 * On decompression Flows, DCE validates the received header information found
 * in the first N1 bytes of the Stream for consistency with the CF field
 * setting. Any inconsistencies in the header or unsupported/reserved values
 * present in the STATUS/CMD fields will result in an Invalid STATUS/CMD error
 * or the appropriate GZIP, ZLIB, or DEFLATE header error.  The PROCESS Command
 * supports the same set of flush parameters as zlib inflate() and deflate()
 * calls do.
