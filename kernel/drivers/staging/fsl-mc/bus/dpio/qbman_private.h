/* To maximise the amount of logic that is common between the Linux driver and
 * other targets (such as the embedded MC firmware), we pivot here between the
 * inclusion of two platform-specific headers.
 *
 * The first, qbman_sys_decl.h, includes any and all required system headers as
 * well as providing any definitions for the purposes of compatibility. The
 * second, qbman_sys.h, is where platform-specific routines go.
 *
 * The point of the split is that the platform-independent code (including this
 * header) may depend on platform-specific declarations, yet other
 * platform-specific routines may depend on platform-independent definitions.

/* For CCSR or portal-CINH registers that contain fields at arbitrary offsets

 *
 * Eg. to "d"ecode a 14-bit field out of a register (into a "uint16_t" type),
 * where the field is located 3 bits "up" from the least-significant bit of the
 * register (ie. the field location within the 32-bit register corresponds to a
 * mask of 0x0001fff8), you would do;
 *                uint16_t field = d32_uint16_t(3, 14, reg_value);
 *
 * Or to "e"ncode a 1-bit boolean value (input type is "int", zero is FALSE,
 * non-zero is TRUE, so must convert all non-zero inputs to 1, hence the "!!"
 * operator) into a register at bit location 0x00080000 (19 bits "in" from the
 * LS bit), do;
 *                reg_value |= e32_int(19, 1, !!field);
 *
 * If you wish to read-modify-write a register, such that you leave the 14-bit
 * field as-is but have all other fields set to zero, then "i"solate the 14-bit
 * value using;
 *                reg_value = i32_uint16_t(3, 14, reg_value);
 *
 * Alternatively, you could "r"emove the 1-bit boolean field (setting it to
 * zero) but leaving all other fields as-is;
 *                reg_val = r32_int(19, 1, reg_value);
