 * holding pre-formatted pieces of hardware commands. The performance-critical
 * code can then copy these descriptors directly into hardware command
 * registers more efficiently than trying to construct/format commands

 * order for the compiler to know its size, but the internal details are not
 * exposed. The following macro is used within the driver for converting *any*
 * descriptor pointer to a usable array pointer. The use of a macro (instead of
 * an inline) is necessary to work with different descriptor types and to work
 * correctly with const and non-const inputs (and similarly-qualified outputs).
