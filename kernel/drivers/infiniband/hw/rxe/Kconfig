	---help---
	This driver implements the InfiniBand RDMA transport over
	the Linux network stack. It enables a system with a
	standard Ethernet adapter to interoperate with a RoCE
	adapter or with another system running the RXE driver.
	Documentation on InfiniBand and RoCE can be downloaded at
	www.infinibandta.org and www.openfabrics.org. (See also
	siw which is a similar software driver for iWARP.)

	The driver is split into two layers, one interfaces with the
	Linux RDMA stack and implements a kernel or user space
	verbs API. The user space verbs API requires a support
	library named librxe which is loaded by the generic user
	space verbs API, libibverbs. The other layer interfaces
	with the Linux network stack at layer 3.

	Rxe_cfg provided with librxe is a configuration tool that
	loads and unloads the ib_rxe kernel modules
